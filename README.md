# 💔 ExFiles.ai — Chat with Your AI Ex

A dramatic, emotional, and *hilariously sassy* AI ex-girlfriend who remembers *everything* — especially the things you wish she didn't.

This is a front-end project that lets you chat with an AI character through a beautifully styled and mobile-responsive interface. Built for fun, sarcasm, and those “what if we got back together?” moments — powered by your code, not your feelings.
